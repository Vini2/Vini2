### Hi there 👋

I’m Vijini Mallawaarachchi—I’m a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/) at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in Canberra, Australia. I enjoy writing code, reading and blogging.

My current research work is focused on algorithms and computational models related to metagenomics binning. Metagenomics involves the study of various genetic material obtained from the genomes found in microbial communities. A microbial community can contain a large number of organisms. My work focuses on developing methods and tools to investigate the taxonomic structure of a given metagenomic sample.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on metagenomics binning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graph algorithms

### Repo Highlights

#### [GraphBin: Refined Binning of Metagenomic Contigs using Assembly Graphs](https://github.com/Vini2/GraphBin)
First tool to make use of assembly graphs to refine binning results from existing metagenomics contig-binning tools.

#### [GraphBin2: Refined and Overlapped Binning of Metagenomic Contigs Using Assembly Graphs](https://github.com/Vini2/GraphBin2)
Next generation og GraphBin that refines binning results from existing metagenomics contig-binning tools using assembly graphs. GraphBin2 also assigns contigs to multiple bins if they are shared between different species.
